Welcome! Here you'll find a handful of projects that I've worked on during my time at Oregon State.

# Project 1: Wine Quality Analysis Using Machine Learning Techniques

This project was one that I did as the final project for ST 599: Topics in Machine Learning. In it, I use machine learning techniques to analyze wine quality samples from 2008.
