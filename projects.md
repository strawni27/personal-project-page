Welcome! Here you'll find a handful of projects that I've worked on during my time at Oregon State.

# Project 1: Wine Quality Analysis Using Machine Learning Techniques

Completed 06/09/2025

This project was one that I did as the final project for ST 599: Topics in Machine Learning. In it, I discuss theory behind machine learning regression techniques, then implement those to analyze wine quality data.
