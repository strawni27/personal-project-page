Welcome! Here you'll find a handful of projects that I've worked on during my time at Oregon State.

# Project 1: Wine Quality Analysis Using Machine Learning Techniques

Completed 06/09/2025

This project was one that I did as the final project for ST 599: Topics in Machine Learning. In it, I discuss theory behind machine learning regression techniques, then implement those to analyze wine quality data.

# Project 2: Monte-Carlo Simulation Study Involving Low-Probability Events in Golf

This is another final project that I did, this time for ST 541: Probability, Computation, and Simulation. This project involved conducting a simulation study to estimate low-probability events, which I chose to apply to the probability of breaking 59 on the PGA Tour.

Completed 12/10/2025
