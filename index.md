My name is Ian Strawn, and this is my personal site! I'm a statistics Masters student at Oregon State University, and I aim to use this space to showcase some of the work that I do as a statistics student and aspiring data analyst. As I work on new projects, I'll upload them to the "Posts" section of this website. Thanks for taking a look!
